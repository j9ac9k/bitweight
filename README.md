# BitWeight

This C++ header and accompanying Python module provide classes designed to make it easier to work with log-probabilites in NLP and ML applications. 

A BitWeight is a real-space value represented internally as a negative base-2 logarithm, similar to that used in the log probability semiring, and used to avoid underflow. 

BitWeight was written by Kyle Gorman and Steven Bedrick.
