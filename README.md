# BitWeight

This Python module provides a class designed to make it easier to work with log-probabilites in NLP and ML applications. 

A BitWeight is a real-space value represented internally as a negative base-2 logarithm, similar to that used in the log probability semiring, and used to avoid underflow. 

More docs to follow; for now, look at the unit tests in ``bitweight.py`` for more examples.

BitWeight was written by Kyle Gorman and Steven Bedrick.
